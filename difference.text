Git and GitHub are often used together, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between Git and GitHub:

**Git:**

1. **Type:** Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that manages the source code of projects locally on your computer.

2. **Functionality:** Git is primarily a tool for version control, allowing developers to track changes in their code, create branches, and manage commits.

3. **Location:** Git repositories are stored on your local machine. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history.

4. **Use Case:** Git is used for tracking changes and collaborating on code within a local environment or on a local network.

5. **Collaboration:** While Git supports collaboration among team members on a local network, it does not provide features for easy remote collaboration.

6. **Hosting:** Git does not offer remote repository hosting services. Developers need to use other services or set up their own Git server for remote collaboration.

**GitHub:**

1. **Type:** GitHub is a web-based platform and service that provides hosting for Git repositories.

2. **Functionality:** GitHub extends Git's capabilities by offering a web-based interface for managing repositories, collaboration tools, and features like pull requests, issues tracking,
and code reviews.

3. **Location:** GitHub hosts repositories on remote servers. Developers can access and collaborate on repositories hosted on GitHub over the internet.

4. **Use Case:** GitHub is used for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories, making it easy for distributed teams to work together on software projects.

5. **Collaboration:** GitHub is designed for remote collaboration. It offers features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews to facilitate collaboration among developers from
different locations.

6. **Hosting:** GitHub provides a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It also offers free hosting for public
repositories and paid plans for private repositories.

In summary, Git is the version control system itself, focused on managing code and history on your local machine or network. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built 
around Git, offering remote hosting and collaboration features to make it easier for teams to work together on software projects. While Git is at the core of version control, GitHub
enhances the collaboration and project management aspects of software development.
