Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development. It tracks changes in code and facilitates collaboration among developers. Git maintains a history of project
modifications, enabling users to create, edit, and merge code across branches. It offers features like branching, allowing multiple development paths, and commits, which record snapshots of
changes with descriptive messages. Developers can work independently on their code, merge changes seamlessly, and resolve conflicts. Git is versatile, supporting local and remote
repositories, enabling collaborative coding across teams and platforms. Its decentralized nature provides robustness and flexibility, making it an essential tool for code management and
version tracking.
