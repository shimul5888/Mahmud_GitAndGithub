GitHub to host and share their Git repositories, allowing teams to collaborate on code, track changes, and coordinate development efforts seamlessly. It provides tools for issue tracking,
code review, and project management through features like pull requests, which facilitate code review and integration. GitHub's social features, such as following users and repositories,
foster a sense of community and knowledge sharing among developers worldwide. With its extensive integration capabilities, it supports automated workflows and continuous
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, streamlining software development processes. GitHub has become an indispensable platform for open-source and private software projects,
fostering innovation and collaboration across the global developer community.
